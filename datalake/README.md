# Datalake exporters

TON-ETL consist of multiple data processing layers and the final one is exporters. The main goal for exporters is to
prepare data for external usage (normalize it, fit into the same model and send to the final destination).
Currently two main destinations are supported:
* AWS S3 Data Lake 
* Near real-time data streaming via public Kafka topics


## AWS S3 Data Lake

Datalake endpoints:
* Mainnet: s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/ (eu-central-1 region)

All data tables are stored in separate folders and named by data type. Data is partitioned by block date. Block date
is extracted from specific field for each data type and converted into string in __YYYYMMDD__ format.
Initially data is partitioned by adding date, but at the end of the day it is re-partitioned using [this script](./repartition.py).

SNS notifications are enabled for the bucket, SNS ARN is ``arn:aws:sns:eu-central-1:180088995794:TONPublicDataLakeNotifications``.

## Near real-time  data streaming via pulic Kafka topics

AWS S3 Data Lake is suitable for batch processing but it doesn't support real-time  data processing.
Pulic Kafka topics are introduced to address this limitation. Data updates from TON-ETL are converted using the
same schema converters as S3 Data Lake and sent to the public Kafka topics. 
Kafka topics endpoints:
* Mainnet: kafka.redoubt.online:9094

Connection params:
* Protocol: SASL_PLAINTEXT, SCRAM-SHA-512
* Data format: JSON
* Data retention: 7 days
* GroupId: mandatory
* Username and password: provided by TON-ETL team

List of topics supported:
* indexer.streaming_account_states
* indexer.streaming_blocks
* indexer.streaming_dex_trades
* indexer.streaming_jetton_events
* indexer.streaming_jetton_metadata
* indexer.streaming_messages (with raw bodies)
* indexer.streaming_transactions
* indexer.streaming_dex_pools

Public Kafka topics are available for free, but to provide better observability and performance we would like to ask you to
contact us for connection credentials linked to your organisation using [the following form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4OhA1pe6OzyaG_gb8plAG8XlJpOkcAw7vo8fSeDeBBGFmCA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Note that the data stream is near real-time with with estimated delay in range 10-30 seconds after the block is processed. 
This delay originates from the multiple reasons:
* Blocks propagation 
* RocksDB indexing
* Decoding layer
* External Kafka broker replication latency


# Data types

All target destinations share the same data model (but underlying data format may be different). This section describes
the data model for supported data types.

## Blocks

[AVRO schema](./schemas/blocks_export.avsc)

Partition field: __gen_utime__
URL: **s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/blocks/**

Contains information about blocks (masterchain and workchains).

## Transactions

[AVRO schema](./schemas/transactions_export.avsc).

Partition field: __now__
URL: **s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/transactions/**

Additionaly we are adding account_state_code_hash_after and account_state_balance_after fields.

## Messages

[AVRO schema](./schemas/messages_export.avsc)

Partition field: __tx_now__
URL: **s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/messages/**

Contains messages from transactions. Internal messages are included twice with different direction:
* in - message that initiated transaction
* out - message that was result of transaction


## Messages with raw bodies

[AVRO schema](./schemas/messages_with_data_export.avsc)

Partition field: __tx_now__
URL: **s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/messages_with_body/**

Contains the same data as ``messages`` table with two more fields:
* body_boc - raw body of the message body
* init_state_boc - raw init state (if present) from the message

## Account states

[AVRO schema](./schemas/account_states.avsc)

Partition field: __timestamp__
URL: **s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/account_states/**

Contains raw account states with raw data and code.


## Jetton events

[AVRO schema](./schemas/jetton_events_export.avsc)

Partition field: __utime__
URL: **s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/jetton_events/**

Contains jetton events, event type is defined in ``type`` field:
* transfer - TEP-74 transfer event
* burn - TEP-74 burn event
* mint - TEP-74 jetton standard does not specify mint format but it has recommended form of internal_transfer message. 
So we are using it as mint event. Also there are some jetton-specific mint implementations, 
the current implementation supports HIPO hTON mints.

All jetton events include tx_aborted field, pay attention that if it is ``false`` then the event should be discarded.
Aborted events are stored becase it could be useful for some types of analysis.

``source`` field is set to ``null`` for mint events and ``destination`` is set to ``null`` for burn events.

Note that fields ``query_id``, ``forward_ton_amount``, ``amount`` are stored as  decimal values with scale equals to 0. Since the data mart
doesn't support off-chain metadata and stores only raw data the amount is stored as raw value without dividing by 10^decimals.

## Jetton metadata

[AVRO schema](./schemas/jetton_metadata.avsc)

Partition field: __adding_at__
URL: **s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/jetton_metadata/**

According to [TEP-64](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md)
standard Jetton metadata could be stored off-chain or on-chain (or even both). Having in mind that the data could be
stored off-chain and may not be available at the time of processing we are using the following approach:
* Get on-chain metadata
* If off-chain metadata is available and the field is present, store value from off-chain metadata
* If off-chain metadata is not available, fallback to [tonapi API V2](https://tonapi.io/api-v2#operations-Jettons-getJettonInfo)
to extract jetton metadata cached by tonapi.

Also for all jettons cached image from tonapi is requested. It is a mitigation for the case when image is not available 
any longer.

Fields description:
* address - jetton master address
* update_time_onchain - time of on-chain update (for example in case of admin address transfer)
* update_time_metadata - time of off-chain update
* mintable - mintable flag (on-chain value)
* admin_address - admin address (on-chain value)
* jetton_content_onchain - JSON serialized into string with on-chain jetton content
* jetton_wallet_code_hash - jetton wallet code_hash (on-chain value)
* code_hash - jetton code hash (on-chain value)
* metadata_status - off-chain metadata update status (0 - no off-chain metadata, 1 - success, -1 - error)
* symbol - TEP-64 jetton symbol (on-chain or off-chain value, see sources field for details)
* name - TEP-64 jetton name (on-chain or off-chain value, see sources field for details)
* description - TEP-64 jetton description (on-chain or off-chain value, see sources field for details)
* image - TEP-64 jetton image url (on-chain or off-chain value, see sources field for details)
* image_data - TEP-64 jetton image data (on-chain or off-chain value, see sources field for details)
* decimals - TEP-64 jetton decimals (on-chain or off-chain value, see sources field for details). Note that if decimals fields is not present it means that the jetton uses default value of 9.
* sources - recored with sources of jetton metadata fields (6 fields for symbol, name, description, image, image_data, decimals). Possible values are:
    * "" - field is not set
    * "onchain" - field is based on on-chain value
    * "offchain" - field is based on off-chain value
    * "tonapi" - tonapi was used to get the value (fallback)
* tonapi_image_url - tonapi cached image url
* adding_date - partition field, date when the output file was created

## Jetton metadata snapshots

``jetton_metadata`` table allows to get the full history of jetton metadata changes but for most cases it is more suitable to have
the latest snapshot of jetton metadata. To simplify usage in this case daily snapshots with the latest metadata are created.

Partition field: __snapshot_date__
URL: **s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/jetton_metadata_snapshots/**

This table contains the same data as ``jetton_metadata`` table but only for the latest snapshot for each jetton.

Note: for performance reasons daily snapshots are splited into 10 files.

It is recommended to use ``jetton_metadata_latest`` view to get the latest snapshot of jetton metadata (see [athena_ddl.sql](./athena_ddl.sql)).


## DEX Trades

[AVRO schema](./schemas/dex_trades.avsc)

Partition field: __event_time__

* project - project name, see the list below
* version - project version
* event_time - timestamp of the event
* event_type - ``trade`` or ``launch``. ``launch`` is used for the event when liquidity is collected from the bonding curve and sent to DEX.

* pool_address - address of the pool, ``null`` if the pool is not known
* router_address - address of the router, ``null`` if the router is not used by the project (see table below)

* platform_tag - platform address, ``null`` if the platform is not specified or not supported by the project (see table below)
* query_id - query id, ``null`` if the query id is not supported by the project (see table below)
* volume_ton - volume in TON
* volume_usd - volume in USD

Volume estimation is based on the amount of tokens sold/bought in the current trade and it is calculated only if the trade involves one of the following assets:
* TON (or wrapped TON)
* USDT (or wrapped USDT or USDC)
* LSD (stTON, tsTON, hTON)

```sql
with latest_balances as (
select * from "balances_snapshot"
where block_date = (SELECT max(block_date) FROM "balances_snapshot$partitions")
)
select * from latest_balances
where asset = 'TON' order by amount desc
limit 100

# Data corrections

This section describes the list of data corrections that were applied to the data lake and should be removed or fixed. 
Data corrections are required in case of incorrect data was stored in the data lake and should be removed or fixed.
In such cases keys of the rows to be excluded are stored in the **excluded_rows** that is stored in **s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/excluded_rows** in CSV format with two fields:
* table - name of the table
* key - key of the row in the table

Data corrections are applied to the data lake by partitions, i.e. full partition is regenerated so there are two options
to the consumers of the data lake:
1. Re-import the partitions
2. Apply data corrections manually


**1. DeDust trades data correction**

Date: 2024-12-11

Table: dex_trades

Key: tx_hash

Partitions: 20241201, 20241203, 20241204

Number of rows: 12

Full list: s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/excluded_rows/dedust_20241211.csv

Description: DeDust swap parses used ext-out messages to detect swaps and before the fix
it was possible to create a smart contract that would send ext-out messages with arbitrary payload
resulting in incorrect trades data parsing. Some users utilised this bug and created three smart contracts
and sent 12 ext-outs. The fix was applied in [#65](https://github.com/re-doubt/ton-etl/pull/65) to mitigate the issue.

# Known issues

* __messages__, __account_states__ and other tables contains wrong values for [anycast addresses](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/msg-tlb#addr_std10) for messages before 02/02/2025 21:30 UTC.
* [Meridian NFT collection](https://tonviewer.com/EQAVGhk_3rUA3ypZAZ1SkVGZIaDt7UdvwA4jsSGRKRo-MRDN?section=overview) has a lack of onchain metadata for items before 2025-01-23 (out of gas issue for get methods).
* [DIGGER GAME PASS NFT collection](https://tonviewer.com/EQAQQD4LjKX7vOut9VZDnwDdXZVH4dCJ9s-_cqznLT9dCo1v) is not indexed due to frozen collection address.


# Integration with Athena

As far the data is stored in S3 in Avro format Athena can directly read it. To start working with the data you need to create table with the DDL
provided in [athena_ddl.sql](./athena_ddl.sql) file and load partitions using ``MSCK REPAIR TABLE`` command.

## Query examples

Get most active jettons from the last 30 days:

```sql
with top_jettons as (
select jetton_master, approx_distinct(trace_id) operations from jetton_events
where block_date >= date_format(date_add('day', -30, current_date), '%Y%m%d')
group by 1
order by operations desc limit 10
)
select symbol, jetton_master, operations from top_jettons 
join jetton_metadata_latest on jetton_master = address
order by operations desc
```
